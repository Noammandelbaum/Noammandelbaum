# 👋 Hi, I'm Noam Mandelbaum  
### QA Automation Engineer · Empathy-Driven Quality

I build reliable systems by focusing on the human experience behind every test.  
Quality, for me, is empathy in action — stability that gives people back time and peace of mind.

## 🌱 What I Stand For

### **Empathy-Driven Engineering**
I test with the user in mind: the tired parent at midnight, the teammate relying on CI stability.  
Quality is not just correctness — it's clarity, trust, and respect for the person behind the screen.

### **Logic, Structure & Improvement**
My work is grounded in clean architecture, predictable patterns, and continuous refinement.  
Good systems evolve, and I build tests and tools that evolve with them.

### **Reliability Over Flashiness**
I prioritize durability and stability.  
Elegant automation is automation that still works six months from now.

# Hey, I'm Noam 👋

**Backend Developer** who leverages AI agents to build faster and better.

I believe the future belongs to developers who collaborate with AI, not compete against it. I use **Claude Code** to accelerate development - what used to take a month now takes days, with higher quality.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

### [SemesterHub](https://github.com/Noammandelbaum/semester-dash) 🎓
A platform helping students see their academic data clearly. The university system (Moodle) shows cluttered information, so I built a **browser extension** that syncs everything to a clean dashboard.

🔗 **Live:** [semester-dash.vercel.app](https://semester-dash.vercel.app/login)

**Tech:** Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Browser Extension, JWT Auth

### [3D Ray Tracing Engine](https://github.com/Noammandelbaum/Advanced-3D-Graphics-Rendering-Engine) 🎨
A complete ray-tracing engine built from scratch in **Java**. Renders 3D scenes with realistic lighting, shadows, reflections, and refractions.

**Tech:** Java, Design Patterns, TDD, Mathematical Modeling
